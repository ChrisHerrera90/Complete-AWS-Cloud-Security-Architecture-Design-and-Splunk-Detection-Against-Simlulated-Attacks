Add everything I did:

- ✅ Create AWS Free Tier account (if not already done).
- ✅ Install Terraform CLI locally.
- ✅ Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) + Terraform extensions.
- ✅ Download Splunk Enterprise Trial (Linux .tgz file).
- ✅ Set up billing alarm in AWS for $10/month threshold.


# Phase 1: Setup the Tools and Services needed to Build the Project
In This phase, I downloaded and installed the following tools and services onto my local computer so that I can initiate the AWS build:

- ✅ Create AWS Free Tier account (if not already done).
- ✅ Install Terraform CLI locally.
- ✅ Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) + Terraform extensions.
- ✅ Download Splunk Enterprise Trial (Linux .tgz file).
- ✅ Set up billing alarm in AWS for $10/month threshold.

This is my starting point. We are now ready for [Phase 2 - Building The Core AWS Network Infrastructure](https://github.com/ChrisHerrera90/Complete-AWS-Cloud-Security-Architecture-Design-and-Splunk-Detection-Against-Simlulated-Attacks/blob/main/Phase%202%20-%20Building%20the%20Core%20AWS%20Infrastructure/Phase%202%20README.md)
