 # Phase 4: Deploying the EC2 Splunk Server and Target Workstations
In This phase, I will use Terraform to build out a Linux server and install/configure Splunk Enterprise for log aggregation across the AWS environment. I will also create two additional Windows EC2 instances within the private subnet that will act as "workstations" that will be targeted later during our simulated attacks.

## üéØ Main Target Goals for this Phase:
- Create a Linux EC2 to install and deploy Splunk in the public subnet.
- Create two additionally Windows EC2 workstations in the private subnet.
- Configure all relevant security groups and NACLs for all instances.

## ‚≠ê Step 1Ô∏è: </> Breakdown of `Ubuntu 22.04 Splunk EC2 Creation.tf` for Linux Splunk Server EC2 Creation

### Creating the VPC Security Group for My Ubnuntu Splunk Server

I begin by creating the EC2 instance security group and naming it `ubuntusplunk_secgroup` with the following inbound/outbound rules: 

`ingress` (inbound traffic) rules:
- Allow open ports for SSH exclusively for my Bastion's private IP
- Allow HTTP traffic from the default Splunk web interface port 8000. This will allow me to log into my Splunk account via this Ubuntu VM.
- Allow this Ubuntu machine to receive logs via port 9991 from any resource within the private network.

`egress` (outbound traffic) rules:
- Allow this security group to reach the internet and communicate with any protocol/port. This will be needed to download the Splunk software, get future updates, etc.

Finally, I made sure to include some `data` blocks to ensure that any values such as the `ami`, `aws_vpc`, and `aws_subnet` was pulling values from our VPC setup in Phase 2.

```tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu_server" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"] 

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "root-device-type"
    values = ["ebs"]
  }
}

data "aws_vpc" "main" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["AWSsecuritylab-VPC"] 
  }
}  

data "aws_subnet" "private" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name" 
    values = ["Private-Subnet"] 
  }
}  

resource "aws_security_group" "ubuntusplunk_secgroup" {
  name = "ubuntusplunk_secgroup"
  description = "allow Splunk related traffic"
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description = "SSH from Bastion only"
    from_port = 22
    to_port = 22
    protocol = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.1.176/32"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "Splunk web UI"
    from_port = 8000
    to_port = 8000
    protocol = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "Splunk indexing port for receiving logs"
    from_port = 9997
    to_port = 9997
    protocol  = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  }

    egress {
    from_port = 0
    to_port = 0
    protocol = "-1"
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "ubuntusplunk_secgroup"
  }
}


```


---
### Creating the EC2 Instance That Will Become the Ubuntu Splunk Server 

Next, I asked Terraform to create the EC2 instance with an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  image (`ami`), assign it to my private subnet, give it a private IP, associate a public IP, assign a key name for SSH login (via the `.tfvars` file), and assign it to the above security group. Additionally, I have allocated 50GiB of storage for the root hard drive as an SSD (`gp3`).

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "Ubuntu-Splunk-EC2" {
  ami = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_server.id.
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id = aws_subnet.private.id
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  key_name = var.key_name
  private_ip = "10.0.1.50"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.ubuntusplunk_secgroup.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "Ubuntu-Splunk-EC2"
  }

  root_block_device {
    volume_size = 50
    volume_type = "gp3"
  }
}

```


---
### Bash Script for Auto-installing Splunk into the Ubuntu Machine
Next, I want to include a BASH script that will auto-download and install Splunk into this EC2 instance. This script is designed to download and install the Splunk version 9.2.1 tarball from Splunk's website, unzips it (`tar -xvzf`) and saves it into the `/opt` folder as a `splunk.tgz` file. Additionally, the script creates a new dedicated `Splunk` user in Ubuntu so that the root user does not have to be used for added security (the `chown` command also gives this user ownership over the Splunk folder). Finally, Splunk is configured to automatically launch at boot.

```tf
  user_data = <<-EOF 
#!/bin/bash
cd /opt
wget -O splunk.tgz https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.2.1/linux/splunk-9.2.1-77f73c9edb85-Linux-x86_64.tgz
tar -xvzf splunk.tgz
useradd splunk
chown -R splunk:splunk splunk
sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes --no-prompt
sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start
EOF

```

### Creating a Variable Key for SSH Access to Ubuntu Splunk EC2

Next, I need to create a variable key that can be used to log into the Windows EC2 server via RDP securely. I also created the `terraform.tfvars` file which holds the key values that will populate in the instance (`terraform.tfvars` file is redacted for security reasons)

```tf
variable "key_name" {
  description = "Name of the AWS key pair to access the Ubuntu Splunk EC2 Instance"
  type = string
}
  
```

---
### üëÄ Executing and Verifying The Terraform Scripts Where Successful (AWS Dashboard)
After writing these scripts, I went ahead and ran them in my Visual Studio Terminal and checked if Terraform validated my code with `terraform validate`. With a successful validation, I went ahead and planned and executed the build by using the `terraform apply` command. Once initiated, we receive a message saying that our resources were successfully created:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffdfcda9-9f96-47db-9840-6b9a3c90a980)

If successful, the Terraform script execution should have resulted in the following AWS creations:
- Security Group (ubuntusppluink_secgroup)
- Ubuntu EC2 Instance (Ubuntu-Splunk-EC2)
- Private IP assigned to the EC2

Once the commands executed, I went to my AWS dashboard to confirm that all of the requested resources and configurations were implemented:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa694225-3b56-4439-9fb4-5e62406bfa73)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaf5a131-98ad-4cf9-baf4-ecc7bd50c985)

### üëÄ Logging into the Ubuntu Server with SSH and Verifying Splunk Installation + Splunk User Creation

Once the Ubuntu EC2 instance was created, I went ahead and SSH'd into it via my Bastion server to verify that Splunkl was installed and that the Spluink user was created as the owner of the Splunk file:




## ‚≠ê Step 2: Connecting to EC2 and Installing Active Directory Domain Services + Upgrading to Domain Controller

### Creating a Bastion Host (Jump Box) to Log into the Private EC2 via RDP
Since our `Windows-AD-EC2` EC2 instance does not have a public IP address (it is in our private subnet), I cannot just RDP into it locally to install Active Directory and upgrade it into my Domain Controller. I could just assign a temporary public IP, but in the spirit of maintaining security principles, I will instead create a Bastion Host (Jump Box) within my VPC public subnet and assign it a public IP. This Bastion Host (Windows EC2) will allow me to RDP into our `Windows-AD-EC2`'s private IP address. To automate this, I have executed the `Bastion Host Creation.tf` file. Here is the breakdown of that code:

---
### Creating The Bastion Host EC2 Security Group so I can RDP Into It
First, I needed to create the appropriate Security Group that will allow me to RDP into the Bastion Host. No other services will be activated. I also set up an `ingress` (inbound) rule that only allows my local IP address to connect via RDP for increased security. Finally I set `egress` rules that will allow Bastion to make outbound connections to private IPs within the private subnet (very important for RDPing from Bastion to other EC2s).

```tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_ami" "windows_server" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["801119661308"] 

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["Windows_Server-2025-English-Full-Base-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }
}

data "aws_vpc" "main" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["AWSsecuritylab-VPC"] 
  }
}  

data "aws_subnet" "public" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["Public-subnet"] 
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "windows_bastion_secgroup" {
  name = "windows_bastion_secgroup"
  description = "allow bastion-related traffic"
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    description = "RDP"
    from_port = 3389
    to_port = 3389
    protocol = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["98.97.112.218/32"]
  }

  egress {
    description = "Allow RDP outbound to AD private subnet"
    from_port   = 3389
    to_port     = 3389
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  }

  egress {
    description = "Allow ephemeral return traffic"
    from_port   = 1024
    to_port     = 65535
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "Bastion-Host-Windows"
  }
}

```

---
### Creating the EC2 Instance That Will Become the Bastion Host (Jump Host)

Next, I ask Terraform to create the EC2 instance with a Windows Server 2025 image (`ami`), assign it to my PUBLIC subnet, give it a public IP, assign a key name for RDP login (via the `.tfvars` file), and assign it to the above security group. Additionally, I have allocated 30GiB of storage for the root hard drive as an SSD (`gp3`).

```tf
variable "key_name" {
  description = "The name of the existing EC2 Key Pair to use for Bastion Host access"
  type        = string
}

resource "aws_instance" "windows_bastion" {
  ami = data.aws_ami.windows_server.id
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  subnet_id = data.aws_subnet.public.id
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  key_name = var.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.windows_bastion_secgroup.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "Windows-Bastion-EC2"
  }

  root_block_device {
    volume_size = 30
    volume_type = "gp3"
  }
}

```

After validating and applying the Terraform commands, I went into the AWS dashboard to confirm the creation of the `windows_bastion` EC2 and `windows_bastion_secgroup` security group:

### Setting Up a Public and a Private NACL so that Bastion and Windows AD can Communicate via RDP

Next, I need to create 2 separate NACL rules for the private and public subnets, respectively. Beginning with the Public subnet NACL (where Bastion lives), I am setting it up so that only my local IP address and my VPC's subnet IP addresses can connect via RDP (both outbound and inbound). This should ensure that both subnets are able to bidirectionally communicate with RDP protocol, allowing me to use the Bastion EC2 to RDP into the Windows AD EC2 (or any other EC2):

PUBLIC SUBNET NACL:

PRIVATE SUBNET NACL:

### RDP Into Windows AD EC2 and Installing Active Directory and Upgrading it to the Domain Controller

Now that we have our Bastion Host setup, we are going to RPD into it via the AWS RDP Client using our key pair from the `.pem` file we created.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9af33fae-0a81-4e18-938e-756408908246)

Once we are in our Bsation Host EC2, we will then use it to RDP into our `Windows-AD-EC2` so we can install and setup Active Directory within it:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4199d114-e05a-474d-9947-35836ef33eb4)

Once we have logged into our Windows AD server EC2, we will first restore our firewall settings and create a new inbound rule allowing RDP traffic from our Bastion server (via its private IP) for future connections:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1ceebb5-d8b0-4ed0-994d-79af9413b8d3)

To begin the installation of Windows AD, we will open `Server Manager` and click on `Add Roles and Features`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a2a9758-8cb5-41c6-a37d-c6711cd3b663)

Then we are going to choose `Role based or feature based installation` so that we can upgrade our Windows Server into the Active Directory role

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/108eef82-d1a5-40d7-b63c-642dd66439db)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53b43aba-ffa8-43b2-8ea2-010fe4685b42)

Then we are going to select the `Active Directory Domain Services` role and include all the features listed for this Windows Server:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9e76c04-ba32-41ae-9438-f02650ef5d84)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3c536a9-2bbf-4385-9bd9-098f4246a454)

Finally, we will click `install` and allow the features to install. Once the installation is complete, we will promote this server to the Domain Controller by clicking on the `Promote this server to a domain controller` link

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/151e7a2f-5bdb-49ae-afb4-010cbd396da6)

Next, I am going to create a new `forest` and follow the rest of the steps for the final installation of the Domain Controller

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8978fdbb-eafa-4d4a-983d-ebf170dd5580)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/492e5094-8550-475a-8614-96d071c0f418)

Upon automatic reboot (after finished installation), we can confirm that the installation was successfully by checking the `Server Manager > Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers` and see that our new domain controller domain is listed:

## ‚≠ê Step 3: Configuring Group Policies and Adding Domains

üö® **Note:** I will add the other EC2 VMs to AD in the next phase.











## Now that I have created the Bastion and Domoain Controller servers, we are ready for [Phase 4 - Deploying the EC2 Splunk Server and Target Workstations](https://github.com/ChrisHerrera90/Complete-AWS-Cloud-Security-Architecture-Implementation-and-Testing-against-a-Simulated-Attack/blob/main/Phase%204%20-%20Deploying%20the%20EC2%20Splunk%20Server%20and%20Target%20Workstations/Phase%204%20README.md)
